# openEO Web Editor
A web-based editor for interactive usage of the openEO API.

The Web Editor currently **supports openEO API versions v1.0.x** (including 1.0.0-rc.2).

## Getting Started

The Web Editor is available at [editor.openeo.org](https://editor.openeo.org) for demo purposes.

You can also build the files yourself and deploy them to any web host:

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Open a command line window and go to the directory which contains the cloned/downloaded web editor files.
4. Configure the web editor by editing `config.js`, `vue.config.js` and `theme.scss` to suit your needs.
6. Install the dependencies by executing `npm install` on the command line
7. 
    * Development: Run the development server by executing `npm start`.
    * Deployment: Build the project by executing `npm run build`. Afterwards upload the content of the `dist` folder to your server.

### Query Parameters

You can use some query parameters to set initial state to the Editor.

* `server`: Set a openEO back-end to connect to by default, e.g. `https://earthengine.openeo.org`
* `discover`: If you want to skip authentication and just show the capabiltiies of the back-end, simply set to `1`.
* `process`: Loads a process from a URL and shows it in the Model Builder. You can also pass a single process name with an optional namespace to the parameter (format: `process@namespace`) to simply add a single process node for that process by default.
* `namespaces`: Loads a additional process namespaces. Multiple namespaces can be separated by a comma (e.g. `vector,sar`).
* `edit-node` Opens the parameter editor for a single process node on start-up. Must have the `process` parameter being set, otherwise will be ignored. You can set two types of values:
  * `1`: If only a single node is being added, opens this node without explicitly naming it.
  * Otherwise, the value must correspond to the node identifier without `#` at the beginning.
