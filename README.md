# openEO Web Editor
A web-based editor for interactive usage of the openEO API.

The Web Editor currently **supports openEO API versions v1.0.x** (including 1.0.0-rc.2).

## Getting Started
The most recent stable version is always available at [editor.openeo.org](https://editor.openeo.org).
There's also a (potentially unstable) [demo](https://open-eo.github.io/openeo-web-editor/demo/) of the development version with all the newest features.

You can also build the files yourself and deploy them to any web host:

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Open a command line window and go to the directory which contains the cloned/downloaded web editor files.
4. Configure the web editor by editing `config.js` and `vue.config.js` to suit your needs.
6. Install the dependencies by executing `npm install` on the command line
7.
    * Development: Run the development server by executing `npm start`.
    * Deployment: Build the project by executing `npm run build`. Afterwards upload the content of the `dist` folder to your server.

### Query Parameters

You can use some query parameters to set initial state to the Editor.

* `server`: Set a openEO back-end to connect to by default, e.g. `https://earthengine.openeo.org`
* `discover`: If you want to skip authentication and just show the capabiltiies of the back-end, simply set to `1`
* `process`: Loads a process from a URL and shows it in the Model Builder.

Example: <https://editor.openeo.org?server=https://earthengine.openeo.org&discover=1&process=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Open-EO/openeo-earthengine-driver/master/tests/data/sample-processgraph.json>
